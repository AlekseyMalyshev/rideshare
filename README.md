# Ride Sharing Application

##Features

This is a ride sharing application. After registration, it allows users to publish their destination and time to ride. Also they can specify that they have a car and seats available. Then based on location proximity, application selects the riders who may share a ride together. Contrary to other applications such as Uber ot Lyft, this one services users, not drivers.

##Limitations

- this application should run on a mobile device, please adjust the screen accordingly
- the application is unfinished :( only login and ride registration work
- ride registration uses geolocation and destination position from google api

then `node server.js`
